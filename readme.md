# PyTorch101
This is a simple repository of my first experiments with the PyTorch package, following some of the tutorial from [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/blitz/tensor_tutorial.html).
I'm already experienced with Tensorflow, so I will focus also on the differences between the two packages.

This series of tutorial is intended only to be of practical usage, not a theoretical analysis of different problems.
