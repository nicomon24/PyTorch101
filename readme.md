# PyTorch101
This is a simple repository of my first experiments with the PyTorch package, following some of the tutorial from [here](https://pytorch.org/tutorials/beginner/deep_learning_60min_blitz.html).
I'm already experienced with Tensorflow, so I will focus also on the differences between the two packages.

This series of tutorial is intended only to be of practical usage, not a theoretical analysis of different problems.

## Part 1 - Using tensors
In this first part we will approach tensor definition and initialization, basic operations like addition and reshaping, plus some cool features like numpy integration and CUDA usage.

## Part 2 - Autograd
In the second part of the tutorial we explore pytorch's automatic differentiation and we show some of its usage.
